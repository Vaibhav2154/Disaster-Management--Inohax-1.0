Twitter Tweet Sentiment Analysis Model 📊✨

This repository hosts a robust machine-learning pipeline designed to classify the sentiment of tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and advanced machine-learning algorithms, this model extracts meaningful insights from raw Twitter data, making it perfect for social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and public sentiment studies.
Features 🚀

  Data Preprocessing 🛠️
        Removes noise like special characters, URLs, numbers, and punctuation.
        Tokenizes text and applies stemming/lemmatization to normalize words.
        Removes stop words to retain only relevant terms.

   Feature Extraction 🔍
        Utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical representations, capturing the significance of words in the dataset.
